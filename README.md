# journal-generator
A simple, poorly-written Python script to generate journal entries.

Clone this repository, and the folder serves as the container for your journal entries. Each subdirectory is a year (e.g. "2021") and the files within each subdirectory are journal entries for a particular date in YYYYMMDD format (e.g. "20210101" for January 1st, 2021). 

Written for Mac, and not really written to be portable. Edit the script to suit your use case.

## How to use
1. Run StartJournalEntry
2. Enter date in YYYYMMDD format (alternatively, just write "today" (without the quotation marks) to get current date)
3. Read terminal output
4. Enjoy
